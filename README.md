# Pokemon
Pokemon frontend using Javascript, Poke API, ReactJS, MaterialUI. üåç

 The following project has been written using ReactJS as a framework, using the Pokemon API ("https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/") and stylished using material UI and CSS.
 
 The project Pokemon implements react-router-dom to create links and apply dynamism, the frontend was made entirely using the MUI components.

The home page shows the entire list of Pokemon (shown in Cards), also it shows the navBar, the search Bar, and the Pokemon types in Chips. When the card is clicked, it redirects to another page and shows the selected Pokemon's details.

Another function added was the infinite scroll, at the beginning you notice that it only shows ten Pokemon per scroll, which allows you to fast the content at the same time that allows you to explore more Pokemons when you scroll down the page.

The chips components shows all the Pokemon types, if you click the page filter the Pokemon, and it shows only the species that contain the same category.

You can search the Pokemon by name, id, or type in the search bar. The results call a detailed page that shows the searched Pokemon.

You can prove all the functionality in the link: https://pokemon-8yt6.vercel.app/
